## 🧭 About Me

I’m a passionate full stack engineer with 12+ years of experience solving complex problems through code. From scaling enterprise SaaS platforms to leading architecture for mission-critical applications, I bring technical depth and product intuition together.

I specialize in building systems that are:
- ⚡ **Fast** (SSR, Caching, GraphQL)
- 🔒 **Secure** (OAuth2, Auth0, custom RBAC)
- 🧩 **Modular & Scalable** (Monorepos, CI/CD, DDD)
- ❤️ **Loved by users and dev teams alike**

I love working with small teams where quality, autonomy, and clarity drive execution.
